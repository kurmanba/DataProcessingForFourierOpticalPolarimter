#**Optical Polarimetry**

Following  Project is an attempt to analyse optical microscope with 
compensator (rotating wave pallets)




##**Contents**

`Muller Standard Elements`

In this section muller matrix for standard elements like `Wavepallet`,
`Linear Polarizer` and operators like `Rotation` and numerical operations
like `computing transfer matrix` for stoke vector could be found.

`Interpolation Methods`

In this section discrete measurements obtained from the instrument could be
approximated by various `Interpolation` methods. (_sinc interpolation_, _Polynomial
interpolations_, _etc_)

`Fourier Transforms`

In this section we perform fourier transform with various means.....

`Optimizers`

Several optimizers were adapted from **scipy** library:

They can be classified as follwing:

**Basinhop:** Heuristic method for obtaining ...
