#**DRR**

The project aims to numerically estimate behavior of the optical setup (Dual rotating retarder)
for reconstruction of optical states. 


##**Contents**

`Mueller Calculations` Modeling of the DRR:

In this section Mueller matrix for standard elements like `Wavepallet`,
`Linear Polarizer` and operators like `Rotation` and numerical operations
like `computing transfer matrix` for stoke vector could be found. 
Digital model of the setup could be changed to add additional manipulations
to the signal.

`Interpolation Methods`



`Maximum Likelihood`



`Fourier Transforms` Optional


`Optimizers`

Several heuristic optimizers were adapted from **scipy** library:

They can be used to extract good operation regimes for given set of parameters.
